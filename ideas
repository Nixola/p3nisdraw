Make game.lua load brush data, create an img out of the png base64, have it send to the server.
have the server get the brush data, render the base64png somehow (not looking forward to that);
try and obtain the raw data from the buffer, use it as a string to index a table. if it already
exists, send the old name and the new name to the client who sent it; if it doesn't, broadcast 
a new brush with png64 and name.

Handle lines' spritebatches better: store maxLength, if not enough clear the batch and create
another with double the size, updating maxLength accordingly. on finish, recreate the batch
using the exact number of points because we can.
